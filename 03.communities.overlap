##relation of species in time, overlap (space multivariate analysis)

library(overlap)
data(kerinci)

# tiger
# The unit of time is the day, so values range from 0 to 1. 
head(kerinci)

summary(kerinci)
#3 columns, zone, species, and time
tiger <- kerinci[kerinci$Sps=="tiger", ] ##comma closes queary

summmary(tiger)

##circular time, to make it from linear to round
# The package overlap works entirely in radians: fitting density curves uses trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan),
# so this speeds up simulations. The conversion is straightforward: kerinci$Time * 2 * pi
kerinci$Timerad <- kerinci$Time * 2 * pi
  head(kerinci)  ##see extra column
tiger <- kerinci[kerinci$Sps=="tiger", ]   
head(tiger) ##see additional column

plot(tiger$Timerad)

##or create new variable for time of tiger, kernel densities = amount of time in an axis

timetig <- tiger$Timerad
densityPlot(timetig, rug=TRUE)  #rug to smooth line

##another species .. excercise: select only the data on the macaque individuals
##use summary(kerinci) to see monkey name: macaque
maca <- kerinci[kerinci$Sps=="macaque", ]   
head(maca)

# selecting the time for the macaque
timemaca <- maca$Timerad
densityPlot(timemaca, rug=TRUE)

##check if there is a time where tiger can eat macaque, the two can meet
#overlap, overlapping kernel densities
overlapPlot(timetig, timemaca)
##grey part is overlap
